# 💰 Paycheck Planner

A paycheck-to-paycheck budgeting app that helps you allocate each paycheck across bills, savings goals, and adjustments. Built with React + Vite.

Instead of monthly budgets, Paycheck Planner organizes your finances around each **pay period** — showing exactly what's due, what you can save, and what's left over.

## ✨ Features

- **Per-period bill tracking** — Mark bills as paid, see what's due this period vs next
- **Split payments** — Split a bill across two pay periods
- **Defer bills** — Push a bill to the next period
- **Partial prepayments** — Pay part of an upcoming bill early to lighten the load next period
- **Pay early** — Pull a future bill into the current period
- **Savings goals** — Set goals with per-check contributions and track progress
- **Editable paycheck amount** — Override the default net pay on a per-period basis
- **One-off adjustments** — Add freelance income, unexpected expenses, or refunds
- **Allocation dashboard** — Visual breakdown of bills vs savings vs remaining
- **Calendar view** — See when bills are due at a glance
- **Period history** — Track savings across past paychecks with averages and best-check stats
